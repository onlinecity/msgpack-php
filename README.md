MessagePack PHP functions
=============

The purpose of this project is to implement [MessagePack](http://msgpack.org/) serialization using only PHP. It aims to work even on very old versions of PHP, such as found in many long-term support server distros, while supporting the modern str8/bin8/bin16/bin32 additions to msgpack.

Additions
-----

 - Supports decoding and encoding str8 and bin8/16/32 types.
 - By analogy to the python implementation, msgpack_unpackb accepts $raw parameter determining handling of str types (default: $raw=True).
 - By analogy to the python implementation, msgpack_packb accepts $use_bin_type parameter determining use of bin types (default: $use_bin_type=False).
 - PHP has no concept of bytes vs unicode strings, so msgpack_packb also accepts $force_str_as_bin parameter forcing the use of bin types event for
   strings that are valid utf-8.

Caveats
-----

 - Only msgpack_packb() and msgpack_unpackb() are defined.
 - It's only tested on [little endian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness) architecture, but should work on big endian as well. 
 - It uses is_x() to select the type, do your casts before using the functions
 - Unlike the official lib you can't pack objects. Feel free to submit a pull request to add this functionality.
 - It will always pack integers into the least amount of bits possible, and will prefer unsigned.
 - It does not support ext/fixext types.
 
Benchmark
-----

Based on [msgpack/php/benchmark.php](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack/blob/master/php/benchmark.php)

As you can see the pure PHP implementation (msgpack-php) is quite slow compared with the great php-extension msgpack has created. 
However when msgpack-php is compiled using HipHop (msgpack-hphp) the performance difference is much less, with msgpack-hphp even beating msgpack in this particular benchmark a few places, perhaps due to the fact that the benchmark itself is compiled with HipHop as well.

The timing values are average seconds sampled 10 times with 10.000 iterations each. Percentages are relative to normal php serialize() (not HipHop's version).
